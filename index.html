        <h3>The basics</h3>
        <p>I was born in Berwyn, Illinois, but moved to Colorado when I was 2.  I grew up in the little town of Elizabeth, Colorado (halfway between Denver and Colorado Springs).
        I am currently studying planetary science at Washington University in St. Louis.  When I'm not in school, I live in Castle Rock, Colorado.</p>
        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>I love to learn more about the world and to express that knowledge and enthusiasm through art.  
        I believe that exploring God's creation helps us grow closer to Him, and that true science does not contradict or supercede faith but rather enhances it.
        This worldview seeps out into all of my various forms of expression, which are constantly growing and changing but frequently include
        animation, drawing, sculpture, music, performing arts, and cinematography.</p>
        <h3>Education</h3>
        <li>Homeschooled until 8th grade</li>
        <li>Attended <a href="https://www.dcsdk12.org/school/chaparral-high-school">Chaparral High School</a> in Parker, Colorado</li>
        <li>Studied <a href="https://eps.wustl.edu/">Earth and Planetary Science</a> at <a href="http://wustl.edu/">Washington University in St. Louis</a></li>
